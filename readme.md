# Implement queue using singly linked list.
# Queue is a linear data structure which follows the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle.  
# A new element is added at the rear end of the queue and an element is removed from the front end of the queue.   

# List of operations:
# ----------------------------------------------
# enqueue: Adds new data at the end of the queue.
# dequeue: Removes data from the front of the queue and returns it.
# peek: Returns the first data from the front of the queue.
# rear: Returns the first data from the end of the queue.
# print: Print the elements present in the queue.
# toArray: Returns the queue as the array.
# length: Returns the length of the queue.
# isEmpty: Returns true if queue is empty, false otherwise.
# clear: Clears the queue.
